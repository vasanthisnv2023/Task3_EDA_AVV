# Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to explore and visualize the dataset to understand data distributions, relationships, and important features.

## Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## EDA Performed
- Histogram analysis of numerical features
- Count plots for categorical features
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap analysis

## Key Insights
- Petal length and width are strongly correlated
- Dataset is balanced across classes
- Petal features are important for prediction

## Conclusion
EDA provides valuable insights into feature behavior and prepares the dataset for machine learning.
